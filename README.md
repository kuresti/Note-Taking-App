# Overview


This is a basic note-taking application. 


In this Note-Taking-pp a note can be created, updated, and deleted. The notes are stored as files in a "notes" folder. In the process of updating a note the existing note files are listed. When a note is chosen to update the original note is read and displayed. In the menu the keyword 'when' is used to present menu choices. A while loop is also used in the menu until the exit choice is made.

It was built for the purpose of learning and practicing what I am learning about Kotlin.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

- Move like function into classes
- Give option in the updateNote() function for appendText()
- Convert the app to Android Studio
